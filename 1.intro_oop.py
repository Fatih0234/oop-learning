# OOP in python revolves around four main concepts:
# - Encapsulation
# - Inheritance
# - Polymorphism
# - Abstraction

# Encapsulation bundles data with methods, inheritance lets you create subclasses, abstraction hides complex details, and polymorphism allows for different implementations.


class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name =  name
        self.age = age
        
# alternative to class
kirk = ["James Kirk", 34, "Captain", 2265]
spock = ["Spock", 35, "Science Officer", 2254]
mccoy = ["Leonard McCoy", "Chief Medical Officer", 2266]

# Classes allow you to create user-defined data structures. You can use classes to model real-world things, like employees, or you can use them to model more abstract concepts, like a point in space.

# a class is lik a form or blueprint for creating objects. 
# An instance is a specific object created from a particular class.
# Just liek many people can fill out the same form, 
# many objects can be created from the same class.
